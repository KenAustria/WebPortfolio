# Portfolio
An aesthetically-pleasing and comprehensive portfolio presenting the scope of my credentials.

## Design
A split-screen aesthetic design, with the left-collumn displaying necessary links and the right-collumn exhibiting resume sections.
The designed site uses Node-Sass and CSS Modules out the box with Create React App v2.
CSS3, CSS Grid, FlexBox, Mixins, and Variables are used throughout the project.
Media queries are implemented for common device breakpoints for responsiveness.

## Development
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
